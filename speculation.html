<p>I’m a bad public speaker and at certain times what I say in this presentation did not reflect my ideas or beliefs.</p>
<p>(3:36) Regrettable usage of the word “ripe”.
    (3:56) I mixed these up: in the Phaedrus, Socrates makes an argument against pederasty and then an argument for pederasty.
    (13:15) The phrase I was looking for was “Scottish Descent”.
    (14:23) Referring to the arid grasslands of the Scottish Highlands.
    (17:05) “Joseph Beuys was a Symbolic Artist”, I mean that for Beuys certain materials have symbolic meaning not inferentially articulated.
    (17:50) Meant to say “mass-extinction” of bees.
    (21:54) The 'Weak Conclusion' sucks, I’d omit this slide. 
    (24:30) Didn’t answer a lot of these questions well because I was nervous. I didn’t directly address Aidain’s question about historical critique. To answer, I think that there is a place for historical critique in speculative work, only if it doesn’t extensively take away the viewer's ability to form their own opinion.
    (31:08) I really like Jake’s comment about what the artwork can accomplish without the help of language, but I was nervous and I didn’t respond well to it. Thank you Jake!
    (34:00) The obligatory identity construction/masculinity question. I went a little too far when I said “I’ve tried desperately to remove myself from the work”. I disagree with this statement. I don’t believe that it’s possible to remove oneself from the work. I’d rather say that I prefer to focus on other aspects of my experience than my own identity.
