<p>March, 2020. I’m a bad public speaker and at certain times what I say in this presentation did not reflect my ideas or beliefs.</p>
<p>(3:36) Regrettable usage of the word “ripe”.
    (3:56) I mixed these up: in the Phaedrus, Socrates makes an argument against pederasty and then an argument for pederasty.
    (13:15) The phrase I was looking for was “Scottish Descent”.
    (14:23) Referring to the arid grasslands of the Scottish Highlands.
    (17:05) “Joseph Beuys was a Symbolic Artist”, I mean that for Beuys certain materials have symbolic meaning not inferentially articulated.
    (17:50) Meant to say “mass-extinction” of bees.
    (21:54) The 'Weak Conclusion' sucks, I’d omit this slide. 
    (24:30) Didn’t answer a lot of these questions well because I was nervous. I didn’t directly address Aidain’s question about historical critique. To answer, I think that there is a place for historical critique in speculative work, only if it doesn’t extensively take away the viewer's ability to form their own opinion.
    (31:08) I really like Jake’s comment about what the artwork can accomplish without the help of language, but I was nervous and I didn’t respond well to it. Thank you Jake!
    (34:00) The obligatory identity construction/masculinity question. I went a little too far when I said “I’ve tried desperately to remove myself from the work”. I disagree with this statement. I don’t believe that it’s possible to remove oneself from the work. I’d rather say that I prefer to focus on other aspects of my experience than my own identity.

    <p>2. Cyprien Gallard's hologram (2) of Max Ernst's "L'Angue du Foyer" (1) for the 2019 Venice Bienalle, posted on Youtube by Анна Коломиец (3) to a melodramatic tune. "Ernst’s goal was to depict the chaos that he saw spreading over Europe and the ruin that fascism brings to countries." Few narrative traces in the image reproduced, fewer in the reproduction reproduced. Somehow the excessive "intensity" is there in all three iterations. <p>
