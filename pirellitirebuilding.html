<p> <mark> The videoâ€™s focus is the Pirelli Tire Building. The first section compares the social history of the building to the idealistic writings of its architect, Marcel Breuer. The second section montages the flowing motion of space in Pixar movies, intended to create a sense of Utopian wonder. The third section displays renderings of common-place words, clad in Pixar-inspired furs. The video is about the possibility of imaginary space versus its reality. </marl> </p>
