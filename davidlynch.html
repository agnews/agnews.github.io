<h1>  </h1>
<p>1. Credits/End or beginning: The entirety of "Cloud Song" by Caribou plays from the perspective of a cloud. Possibly zoom out, possibly look onto a city. Possibly animated. </p>
<p>2. Adaptation of Phaedrus: zoom into The Soul of character: Two horses and  a charioteer, One horse (Pathos) is uncontrollable. The other horse (Logos) is well-controlled. Possibly human faces, possibly all the same face. Possibly chasing towards a sexual desire. </p>
<p>3. Character is a bear. Possibly animated/partially human</p>
<p>4. Possible setting: Athens (415 BC) </p>
<p>7. Architectural element: characters move in a shakespearean way within a Brutalist building, hiding behind areas, etc.</p>
<p>8. Characters: power dyanmic, no constancy- shifts throughout. No resolve. No clear understanding of characters (morally). Both good and bad</p>
<p>9. You spend all of this time developing a character. He's a tribal leader in precolonialised Nigera, so maybe Ife culture? You learn that he's very good at operating within the rules set forth by his culture, which is why he's a leader. You come to admire his intellegence and social abilities, not because he's necessarily a good before, but because he's smart. Then the Portoguese come and immediately shoot him in the face. Character development all for nothing. </p>
