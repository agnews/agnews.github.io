<p>1. The video’s focus is the Pirelli Tire Building. The first section compares the social history of the building to the grandiose words of its architect, Marcel Breuer. The second section compares Breuer’s notions of space to techniques in Pixar movies intended to create a sense of Utopian wonder. The third section displays furry, digital words naming common-place objects. The video is about the possibility of imaginary space versus its reality. </p>

<p>2. The exhibit is encircled by a wall of tiny beeswax blocks. The insignia on each block resembles an anthropomorphized bee in the stance of Da Vinci’s ‘Vitruvian Man’. Like how ‘Vitruvian Man’ signified an architecture taken from the male body, these ‘Vitruvian Bees’ signify an architecture taken from anthropomorphized bees.</p>
