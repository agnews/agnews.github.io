<h1> Sculptures </h1>
<p> I don't really like finishing things but I have some ideas. I actually don't think I really enjoy making stuff physically. I like thinking about stuff I could make. Some of these projects are half-finished, and many are just proposals. Some I don't have images for yet. :) </p>

    <p>March 2020. I made hundreds of tiny beeswax blocks. I'd build big walls composed of these blocks, which the viewer would have to delicately manuever around. The insignia on each block resembles an anthropomorphized bee in the stance of Leonardo’s ‘Vitruvian Man’. Like how ‘Vitruvian Man’ signified an architecture of the male body, these ‘Vitruvian Bees’ signify a popularized <a href="https://www.hudsonyardsnewyork.com/discover/vessel">architecture of anthropomorphized bees.</a></p>

    <img src="vertiblock1.jpg" style="width:100%; max-width: 500px" />
    <p> April 2020. Idea #1: A bouldering performance would take place atop a pair of 1,725LB ‘Verti-blocks’. ‘Verti-blocks’ are used to construct retaining walls which redistribute land. In the city, their backside is concealed with dirt while their front appears indistinguishable from natural stone. They manipulate physical space while reconstituting our material-perception of Nature. The climber experiences no sublime as he perpetually clambers over this ‘simulation of nature’, his actions fail to bring him anywhere other than the place he already knows.  </p>
    <img src="rubberrock.jpg" style="width:100%; max-width: 500px" />   
    <p> Idea #2: Real rocks are cast directly in the polyurethane rubber used for concrete molds. The rubber rocks are then placed beneath the full weight of the Vertiblocks, smushed so that they are no longer identifiable as rocks. Thereby, the model which produces 'new nature' is abstracting 'old nature'.   </p>
    <img src="sugarhouse.jpg" style="width:100%; max-width: 500px" />   
    <p> Idea #3: "Sugar House". A live event where participants are asking to build snow forts in relation to the Verti-blocks. In the act, the nostalgic construction of imaginary space is set in relation to obstacles which construct our physical spaces in urban settings. The event never occured because it never snowed. </p>

    <img src="basketballshoes.jpg" style="width:100%; max-width: 800px" />
    <p> October 2020. UNFINISHED. Basketball players in the NBA sometimes handwrite messages on their shoes to inform their game, or to convey certain emotional sentiments to fans. I've inscribed two pairs of NBA shoes with Ay-O's "Rainbow No. 1 for Orchestra": "Soap bubbles are blown out of various wind instruments. The conductor breaks the bubbles with his baton." As if, the image it conjures will effect the movement of the wearer. Materialize as physical shoes? A performance?  </p>

    <p> 'Lookers' concept. Forcing historicals figures to contemplate artworks, viewers, themselves, etc. </p>
    <img src="jacksonpollock.jpg" style="width:100%; max-width: 500px" />
    <p>Idea #1: Jackson Pollock contemplates the limits of the subconcious as he watches Pixar's Inside Out. </p>

    <p> December 2020. "Soul". The pixar film Soul (2020) plays on a TV atop a grassy slope, similar to the one described by Plato in the Phaedrus. There's a big tree, and a river nearby. The environment enamours a peaceful meditation on various historical conceptualization of the human soul. Quoted, “By Here, it really is a beautiful resting place. The plane tree is tall and very broad; the chaste-tree, high as it is, is wonderfully shady, and since it is in full bloom, the whole place is filled with its fragrance. From under the plane tree the loveliest spring turns with very cool water-our feet can testify to that. The place appears to be dedicated to Achelous and some of the Nymphs, if we can judge from the statues and votive offerings. Feel the freshness of the air; how pretty and pleasant it is; how it echoes with the summery, sweet song of the cicas’ chorus! The most exquisite thing of all, of course, is the grassy slope: it rises so gently that you can rest your head perfectly when you lie down on it. You’ve really been the most marvelous guide, my dear Phaedrus.” </p>

    <p> April 2020. PROPOSAL: In the center of the room, there is a statue of two greyhounds plated in stainless steel. Each has a positive/negative review from Greyhound Bus engraved on its spine. One caresses the ear of the other. <a href="greyhound.html" style="color: black"> Greyhounds. </a></p>

    <p> October, 2020. PROPOSAL Version #1 "Maple Tree as Producer and Consumer". A maple tree is tapped. Maple sugar flows out from the tree through a rubber tube which goes back into the tree. Version #2 "Maple Tree Forced-Cannibalism" Maple sugar flows from one tree into a second tree nearby. Maple sugar from the second tree flows into the free tree. A pump is installed inbetween the two trees which forces the continual flow of maple sugar in and out of eachother. </p>
